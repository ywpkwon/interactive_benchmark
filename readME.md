# Benchmarking project

## Requirements
    sdf
    asdf

### pip
There could be more.

    pip install easydict tqdm

### Dash
You will need to install [Dash](https://plot.ly/dash/). This is basically for web-launching plots. I am also thinking to visualizing results without Dash for development stages, but it is not done yet.

    pip install dash==0.18.3  # The core dash backend
    pip install dash-renderer==0.11.0  # The dash front-end
    pip install dash-html-components==0.8.0  # HTML components
    pip install dash-core-components==0.13.0  # Supercharged components
    pip install plotly --upgrade  # Plotly graphing library used in examples
